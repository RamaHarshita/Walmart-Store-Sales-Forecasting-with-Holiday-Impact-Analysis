# Walmart-Store-Sales-Forecasting-with-Holiday-Impact-Analysis
In this project, students are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset.
